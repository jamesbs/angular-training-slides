## What Makes Angular Good?

- Modular architecture
- Better performance than Angular 1:
  - Improved Change detection
  - Ahead of Time compiler
- It's made to scale:
  - Modules
  - Dependency Injection (that makes sense)
  - Typescript and tooling
  - Supporting projects: CLI, Universal, Nativescript
- A complete and opinionated solution
- You don't need to be a Javascript expert
- Can be integrated with Redux

## Getting Set Up

1. Install NVM (Node Version Manager) -- [nvm.sh](http://nvm.sh)
1. Install the latest LTS version of node -- `nvm install --lts`
1. Install Angular CLI -- `npm install --global @angular/cli`

## Creating a New Project

`ng create [project-name]`

This will:

- Install Angular
- Install node dependencies
- Create scaffolding

---

## Project Structure

- `package.json` -- project metadata
- `node_modules` -- libraries and dependencies used by our application
- `src` folder -- application code
- `tsconfig.json` -- TypeScript configuration

---

## TypeScript

- TypeScript is exactly like JavaScript, but with types
- Has ES6 and ES7 features
- Compiles to JavaScript before being run in the browser
- No runtime support for types
